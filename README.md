# 📦 Service Object in Ruby on Rails

## 📌 Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a practical introduction to the **Service Object** concept in the Ruby on Rails framework, demonstrating how to separate responsibilities and keep controllers and models clean and focused on their primary roles.

---

## 🧠 What is a Service Object?

A **Service Object** is a class responsible for encapsulating specific business logic that doesn't naturally belong in models or controllers. They are useful when you want to:

- Avoid bloated controllers (fat controllers)
- Keep models simple and focused on persistence-related logic
- Reuse complex business logic across different parts of the application
- Improve the testability of your code

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Ruby 3.x
- Rails 7.x
- PostgreSQL (or the database of your choice)
- RSpec (optional, for testing)
- Rubocop (for static code analysis)
